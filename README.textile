h1. What is Num-fu?

Num-fu is a plugin build for "Woobius":http://www.woobius.com, which handles uploads coming via "nginx's upload module":http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html. More info on that upload module "here":http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/07/20/nginx-upload-module.

It's worth noting that this is not a straightforward adaptation of AttachmentFu to the Nginx Upload Module. I've picked out the functionality that we are actually using, and much of AttachmentFu has been left aside. This plugin has perhaps 5% of the functionality of Attachment-Fu, and no intention to build in things like image processing, S3 support, thumbnails, etc.

h1. Can I use this?

Yes, go for it. You may fork it and/or use and abuse it in any way you like.

h1. How can I use this?

h2. Usage:

p. Your model should look something like this:

                  	:path_prefix  => STORAGE_FOLDER
end
</pre>

You will need the following fields set up on your FileReference schema:
